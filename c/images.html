<div class="example">
<p>I need to build the set for <em>Hamlet</em> and don't know where to start. I send a letter to <em>16 Soliloquoy Road</em> asking, <q>Hey, could you send me the latest script and this time include pictures?</q></p>

<p>An envelope arrives containing the text of the script and a bunch of loose copies of sketches. The sketches all have labels on the back: <q>Hamlet's castle from the front</q>, <q>Hamlet's castle from the back</q>, and so on. Flipping through the script I see Bill's written little notes like, <q>The drawing of Hamlet's castle from the front goes here.</q></p>

<p>A note falls out of the envelope. It says, <q>Hope you don't mind me sending the sketches separate from the script. I might want to send you better sketches later on and this way you can just swap them out without me having to reprint everything.</q></p>

<p>When you see an image on a webpage, what you're actually seeing is a window to a completely different file. It's like a little mini-webpage stuck on (or <dfn>embedded</dfn> in) your main webpage.</p>

<p>This is because an image takes up way more lines of code than the rest of the content on a website, and it's written in a different language that looks like gobbledygook to humans. You <em>could</em> paste all that image code into your website's code, but that would mean when you're editing your website you'd have to dodge around this huge ugly block of text all the time.</p>

<p>So instead you just write the URL of the image you want to show. Then, when a server serves up your webpage, it also serves the image as a separate file, and tells your web browser how to display it.</p>

<p>Not only does this make your website's code a gazillion times easier for you to read, it also means you can change the pictures on your website without having to touch any code. Just upload the new version of a picture to the same URL as the old version. Your server's going to serve whatever it finds at the URL.</p>
