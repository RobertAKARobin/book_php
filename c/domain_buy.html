<p>Like a phone number, you don't actually <em>own</em> a domain. You sort-of <em>rent</em> it from a <i>registrar</i>, like IWantMyName&#46;com or GoDaddy&#46;com. Renting a domain usually costs less than $20, and you can have as many as you want.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>Domains are <em>so</em> cheap that it's really easy to hoard them. I'll come across some catchy word or phrase and think, <q>I should totally make a website named that,</q> and buy the domain. The result is I have a couple dozen domains collecting dust.</p>
</div>

<p>Phone numbers have area codes. Mine is<code>513</code> for southwestern Ohio even though I don't live there. Domains have <dfn>top-level domains</dfn> (TLDs). My website TLD is <code>.com</code> for <q>company</q> even though I'm not a company.</p>

<p>A few TLDs are restricted, like <code>.gov</code> which can only be used by governments. The rest don't really have rules. I live in the USA but could buy a <code>.ru</code> domain (short for 'Russia') and write the whole thing in Chinese.</p>

<p>There used to be a small number of TLDs. Now there's <code>.in</code> for India, <code>.es</code> for Spain, <code>.attorney</code>, <code>.pink</code>, <code>.sexy</code>, and many more. <code>.com</code> is one of the oldest and most familiar to people, so it's the most popular.</p>

<p>That's one reason so many new companies have weird names. If you run a business selling cat photos it would make sense to name your business <em>CatPhotos</em>. But if <code>catphotos&#46;<strong>com</strong></code> is taken, and <code>catphotos&#46;<strong>net</strong></code> and <code>whiskerly&#46;<strong>com</strong></code> are available, you're probably better off naming your business <em>Whiskerly</em>.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>You might see websites that are totally blank except for a message saying, <q>Buy this domain for $2000!</q> That's called <i>domain squatting</i>: people buying domains just to jack up the price and re-sell them, not to actually use them. It's sleazy, really annoying, and might be illegal soon.</p></div>
