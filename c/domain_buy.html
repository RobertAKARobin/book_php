<p>You don't actually <em>own</em> a domain or a phone number, you sort-of <em>rent</em> it. You're the only one who can use it until your lease expires.</p>

<p>Renting a domain usually costs less than $20. You can rent as many as you want from a <i>registrar</i>, like IWantMyName&#46;com or GoDaddy&#46;com. Registrars all sell the same domains.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>Domains are <em>so</em> cheap that it's really easy to hoard them. I'll come across some catchy word or phrase and think, <q>I should totally make a website named that,</q> and buy the domain. The result is I have a couple dozen domains collecting dust.</p>
</div>

<p>Phone numbers have area codes, like mine, <code>513</code> for southwestern Ohio. I haven't lived there in 7 years. Domains have <dfn>top-level domains</dfn> (TLDs) like <code>.com</code>, which is short for <q>company.</q> Lots of .coms have nothing to do with business.</p>

<p>A few TLDs are restricted, like <code>.gov</code>, which can only be used by governments. The rest don't have rules. I live in the USA but could buy a <code>.ru</code> domain (short for 'Russia') and write the whole thing in Chinese.</p>

<p>There used to be just a few TLDs. Now there's <code>.in</code> for India, <code>.es</code> for Spain, <code>.attorney</code>, <code>.pink</code>, <code>.sexy</code>, and many more. These might be cheaper than <code>.com</code> but will make your website's URL harder to remember. Many businesses choose their names by which <code>.com</code> domains are available.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>You might think, <q>I should buy a bunch of cheap domains, wait for people to want to buy them from me, and sell them at a high price!</q> That's called <em>domain squatting.</em> It's sleazy, not worth it, and sucks for everyone else.</p></div>
