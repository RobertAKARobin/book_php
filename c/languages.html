<p><i>Code</i> is text a computer can read (or <dfn>parse</dfn>) that tells it to do something. A <i>language</i> is a type of code. A webpage is usually written with two different languages called <dfn>HTML</dfn> and <dfn>CSS</dfn>. Using two languages actually makes things a lot simpler.</p>

<code>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;div class="term"&gt;<dfn>HTML</dfn>&lt;/div&gt; changes the &lt;div class="term"&gt;<dfn>semantic value</dfn>&lt;/div&gt; of words.&lt;/div&gt;
</code>

<p><i>Semantic value</i> is a fancy way of saying <q>what words do, compared to the other words around them.</q> On this page, the semantic value of the words at the top is that it introduces the rest of the page.</p>

<p>CSS is the language you use to <dfn>style</dfn> words &mdash; to change the way they look:</p>

<pre>
.term
{
font-weight:bold;
}
</pre>

<p>Why have two different languages? </p>
