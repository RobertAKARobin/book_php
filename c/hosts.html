<p>If I buy <code>RobinIsACoolDude.com</code> and immediately open that up in a web browser I'll get a "page not found" error. A domain without a <dfn>server</dfn> is like a phone number without a phone. A server without a <dfn>host</dfn> computer is like a phone without someone to answer it.</p>

<p><q>Host</q> really just means <q>a computer that's connected to the Internet.</q> But when you're talking about web design <q>host</q> means the computer storing your website's files and running its server. Your server is the computer program that "lives" on your host and answers requests for the files inside it. Remember the secretary with the phone and the filing cabinet?</p>

<p>You can turn pretty much any computer into a host. You can even run a server on your own personal computer, which is called <dfn>self-hosting</dfn>. I don't know anyone who actually does that, because if you're self-hosting and turn off your computer, your whole website goes down. If you're using your computer to watch a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> marathon it will serve requests really slowly.</p>

<p>There are lots of different server programs &mdash; <em>Apache</em>, <em>Oracle</em>, and so on. They can be really hard to install and keep running, and how exactly they work is pretty complicated. Fortunately, like a lot of things in web design, you don't need to know <em>how</em> they work in order to work <em>with</em> them. Until you get into <em>really advanced</em> web design, what I've talked about so far is all you need to know.</p>
