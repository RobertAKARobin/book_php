<p>Every machine connected to the Internet has its own "phone number," called an <dfn>IP address</dfn>. (IP stands for <q>Internet Protocol.</q>) Your personal computer has one. So does a computer running a website. If Will Smith was a website, his IP address would be <kbd>86.75.30.9</kbd>.</p>

<p>To view a website, you need its IP address. But <kbd>86.75.30.9</kbd> is hard to remember. So instead we use <dfn>domain names</dfn>, like <kbd>willsmith.com</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you look up <q>Will Smith</q> in a phone book, it will tell you Will has the phone number <kbd>867-5309</kbd>. If you look up <kbd>willsmith.com</kbd> in the Internet's "phone book" &mdash; called the <dfn>DNS</dfn> (Domain Name System) &mdash; it will tell you <kbd>willsmith.com</kbd> has the IP address <kbd>86.75.30.9</kbd>.</p>

<p>When you dial <kbd>4-1-1</kbd> on your phone you're connected to a special system that looks up phone numbers in the phone book for you. When you enter a domain in your web browser you're connected to a special computer called a <dfn>nameserver</dfn> that looks up IP addresses in the DNS for you.</p>

<p>This happens so quickly and quietly that you don't even notice. If you weren't learning about web design, you could go your whole life without seeing an IP address.</p>
