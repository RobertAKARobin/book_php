<p>Every machine connected to the Internet has its own "phone number." Your computer has one. So does the computer that runs my website. To view my website, people need that number. But <code>216.194.168.37</code> is hard to remember, so instead I tell people to go to <code>robertakarobin.com</code>, which is easier to remember. This is sort-of like how Will's phone number is actually <code>976-4841</code>, but he tells people to dial <code>WSMITH-1</code>.</p>

<p>That "phone number" is called an <dfn>IP address</dfn>. (IP stands for <q>Internet Protocol.</q>) <code>robertakarobin.com</code> is a <dfn>domain</dfn>.</p>

<p>A domain is to an IP address the way <code>WSMITH-1</code> is to <code>976-4841</code> &mdash; it keeps people from having to remember a huge number &mdash; and the way Will Smith is to <code>976-4841</code> &mdash; it "owns" that number uses it to connect with people.</p>

<p>When you go to <code>robertakarobin.com</code> in your web browser, that <em>request</em> is sent to a special computer called a <dfn>nameserver</dfn>. The nameserver looks up the IP address for <code>robertakarobin.com</code> in the Internet's "phone book," called the <dfn>DNS</dfn> (Domain Name System). This phone book lists <code>robertakarobin.com</code> as having the number <code>216.194.168.37</code>. So the nameserver tells your computer to send its request to <code>216.194.168.37</code>.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>This happens so quickly and quietly that you don't even notice. If you weren't learning about web design, you might never even see an IP address.</p></div>

<p>When you set up a website the DNS is updated to show what IP address belongs to your domain. That update is sent to (or <q>propogated among</q>) all the nameservers in the world.</p>
