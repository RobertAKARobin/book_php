<p>Every computer pixel contains three lights: one red, one green*, and one blue. To make a pixel a certain color you tell the computer how bright each light should be, from <kbd>000</kbd> (off) to <kbd>255</kbd> (full-blast). For example, blue would be <kbd>000,000,255</kbd>, purple <kbd>255,000,255</kbd>, and yellow <kbd>255,255,000</kbd>. The problem is computers only give you 2 characters to write this value, and the biggest value you can make using regular <dfn>decimal</dfn> integers (with 10 possible values, 0-9) is 99.</p>

<p><dfn>Hexadecimal</dfn> (or <dfn>hex</dfn>) integers have 16 possible values, letting you get up to 255 in 2 characters. Hex uses the first 6 letters of the alphabet, A-F, to represent the numbers 10-15. So 0 is <kbd>00</kbd>, 15 is <kbd>0F</kbd>, 16 is <kbd>10</kbd>, 160 is <kbd>A0</kbd>, and 255 is <kbd>FF</kbd>.</p>

<div class="aside">*It's green instead of yellow because computer light is "additive" whereas natural light is "subtractive." I don't really know what that means, but it's science.</div>
<p>Extra credit: What words can you make using 6 hex characters? <kbd>0ff1ce</kbd> is sea green, <kbd>beaded</kbd> is soft purple, <kbd>c0ffee</kbd> is a very light blue, <kbd>defec8</kbd> is kind of a pastel yellow-green.</p>
