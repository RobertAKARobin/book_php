<p>I told some of my Hollywood friends about the music video I'm wroking on and now they all want to use Will's music. He's getting a lot of calls like, <q>Hey, rap for me!</q></p>

<p>Will's written a lot of raps and is really bad at choosing which one to perform. So he makes a list of everything he's written. Now whenever someone calls but doesn't ask for a specific rap he just reads them the list and they pick one.</p>

<p>A cookbook is a collection of recipes. To look up a recipe you need to know its page number. Cookbook authors don't expect you to memorize the page number of every single recipe, so they include an index at the end.</p>

<p> A web directory is a collection of files. To look up a file you need to know its URL. Web developers don't expect you to memorize the URL of every single file, so they include a page called <code>index.html</code> in every directory. When someone goes to a directory's URL without specifying a file the server will automatically show them <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Go to <code>amazon.com</code> and you'll see it's exactly the same as <code>amazon.com/index.html</code>. The index is the first site that people will see, so Amazon has worked hard to make it look nice and be good at helping folks get to other pages on <code>amazon.com</code>. If a server can't find an index it'll generate one itself as needed that's just a boring list of URLs.</p>

<aside><p>My dad has long been confused about the difference between a <q>webpage</q>, a <q>website</q>, and a <q>homepage</q>. <code>Amazon.com</code> is a website, your Amazon shopping cart is a webpage, and <code>amazon.com/index.html</code> is Amazon's homepage.</p>
<p>Your web browser also probably has a "homepage" or "home" setting, which is totally unrelated. That's the webpage you want your browser to open when you boot up your computer.</p></aside>
