<div class="example">
<p>A lot of other people also want to make his website. His secretary's getting a lot of calls like, <q>Hey, tell me a story from Will's life!</q></p>

<p>Will has a lot of stories and his secretary doesn't know which one to pick. So she makes a list of everything Will has written. Now whenever someone calls but doesn't ask for a specific story she just reads them the list and they pick one.</p>

<p>A cookbook is a book that contains recipes. To look up a recipe you need to know its page number. Cookbook authors don't expect you to memorize the page number of every single recipe, so they put an index at the end of the book.</p>

<p> A directory is a folder that contains files. To look up a file you need to know its URL. Web developers don't expect you to memorize the URL of every single file, so they include a page called an <dfn>index</dfn> in every directory. When someone goes to a directory's URL without specifying a file the server will automatically show them <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Go to <code>amazon.com</code> and you'll see it's exactly the same as <code>amazon.com/index.html</code>. The index is the first site that people will see, so Amazon has worked hard to make it look nice and be good at helping folks get to other pages on <code>amazon.com</code>. If a server can't find an index it'll generate one itself.</p>

<aside><p>My dad has long been confused about the difference between a <q>webpage</q>, a <q>website</q>, and a <q>homepage</q>. <code>Amazon.com</code> is a website, <code>index.html</code> is a webpage, and <code>amazon.com/index.html</code> is Amazon's homepage.</p>
<p>Your web browser also probably has a "homepage" or "home" setting, which is totally unrelated. That's the webpage you want your browser to open when you boot up your computer.</p></aside>
