<p>This book has a lot of pages on different topics. To find a topic so you can read about it, you need to know its page number. I don't expect you to memorize the page number of every single topic in this book, so I put an index at the beginning.</p>

<p> A directory is a folder that contains files. To look up a file you need to know its URL. Web developers don't expect you to memorize the URL of every single file, so they include a page called an <dfn>index</dfn> in every directory. When someone goes to a directory's URL without specifying a file the server will automatically show them <kbd>index.html</kbd>.</p>

<p>Go to <kbd>amazon.com</kbd> and you'll see it's exactly the same as <kbd>amazon.com/index.html</kbd>. The index is the first site that people will see, so Amazon has worked hard to make it look nice and be good at helping folks get to other pages on <kbd>amazon.com</kbd>. If a server can't find an index it'll generate one itself.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>My dad has long been confused about the difference between a <q>webpage</q>, a <q>website</q>, and a <q>homepage</q>. <kbd>Amazon.com</kbd> is a website, <kbd>index.html</kbd> is a webpage, and <kbd>amazon.com/index.html</kbd> is Amazon's homepage.</p>
<p>Your web browser also probably has a "homepage" or "home" setting, which is totally unrelated. That's the webpage you want your browser to open when you boot up your computer.</p></div>
