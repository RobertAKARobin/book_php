<p>The good news is the performance went really well. The bad news is now people want to perform Will's raps all over the world. His secretary's getting a lot of calls like, <q>I need lyrics for Will's rap song!</q></p>

<p>There are a lot of songs in that <q>Raps</q> folder. His secretary doesn't know which to read. So when someone needs a rap but doesn't say which one she just reads out all their labels and asks the caller to pick one.</p>

<p>A cookbook is a book that contains recipes. To look up a recipe you need to know its page number. Cookbook authors don't expect you to memorize the page number of every single recipe, so they put an index at the end of the book.</p>

<p> A directory is a folder that contains files. To look up a file you need to know its URL. Web developers don't expect you to memorize the URL of every single file, so they include a page called an <dfn>index</dfn> in every directory. When someone goes to a directory's URL without specifying a file the server will automatically show them <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Go to <code>amazon.com</code> and you'll see it's exactly the same as <code>amazon.com/index.html</code>. The index is the first site that people will see, so Amazon has worked hard to make it look nice and be good at helping folks get to other pages on <code>amazon.com</code>. If a server can't find an index it'll generate one itself.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>My dad has long been confused about the difference between a <q>webpage</q>, a <q>website</q>, and a <q>homepage</q>. <code>Amazon.com</code> is a website, <code>index.html</code> is a webpage, and <code>amazon.com/index.html</code> is Amazon's homepage.</p>
<p>Your web browser also probably has a "homepage" or "home" setting, which is totally unrelated. That's the webpage you want your browser to open when you boot up your computer.</p></div>
