<p><dfn>Hosting services</dfn> are businesses that rent you space on super-fast computers that are made just to run servers. Usually they keep hundreds of these computers in huge underground "server farms."</p>

<p>Hosting services usually sell domains, too. You don't have to change your website's domain to change hosts. You just change the DNS records so that the IP address of your website is the IP address of your new host.</p>

<p>Hosting is cheap: I pay about $6 a month. One reason it's so cheap is that my website uses a <i>shared server</i> with several other people's websites. If I was really paranoid about security, or was expecting my site to get a million views every day, I might want to pay more to use faster computers or use  a <i>dedicated server</i> that would serve only my site.</p>

<p>But I'm just an average guy. If I Google "web hosting" anything on the first page of results will probably suit my needs. I'd recommend going with a hosting service that has an easy-to-use website with lots of helpful documentation.</p>
