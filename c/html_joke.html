<p>Read this aloud:</p>

<pre>What does a cloud wear on its butt? Thunderpants.</pre>

<p>Now try reading it this way:</p>

<pre>What does a cloud wear on its butt?


Thunderpants.</pre>

<p>It sounds funnier the second way. That's because the first part has a different purpose from the second part. Putting a space in there gives you a hint that <q>thunderpants</q> is the punchline.</p>

<p>A computer won't get the hint. Letters and spaces are just pieces of data in its memory. They don't <em>mean</em> anything. To tell a computer that joke, you'd need to say something like this:</p>

<pre>Hey computer, this is a joke. Hey computer, this is the set-up. What does a cloud wear on its butt? Hey computer, that's the end of the set-up. Hey computer, this is the punchline. Thunderpants. Hey computer, that's the end of the punchline. Hey computer, that's the end of the joke.</pre>

<p>Here's another way of writing that:</p>

<pre>&lt;div class="joke"&gt;
    &lt;div class="setup"&gt;What does a cloud wear on its butt?&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="punchline"&gt;Thunderpants.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>This is how webpages are written. It's called <i>HTML</i>.</p>

<div class="example">

<p>I'm there on stage in front of a million people with the phone by my ear and a microphone by my mouth, waiting for Will's secretary to read me the lyrics.</p>

<p>She says, <q>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, by Will Smith.</q></p>

<p>I say, <q>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, by Will Smith.</q></p>

<p>The secretary yells, <q>You weren't supposed to say that! It's just the name of the song!</q></p>

<p>I groan and duck away from the microphone. <q>I don't know which words are regular lyrics and which aren't! I need you to tell me! Look, before you say the name of the song, say <q>Heads up. Song name.</q></q></p>

<p>She says, <q>Heads up. Song name. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, by Will Smith. In West Philadelphia, born and raised... <strong>Why aren't you saying anything?!</strong></q></p>

<p><q>You never told me the song name was over!</q></p>

<p><q>OK, before the song name I'll say <q>Heads up. Song name.</q> After it I'll say <q>Heads up. Song name over.</q></q></p>
