<p>You only need two pieces of software to make a website: a web browser and a <dfn>plain text</dfn> editor. Both of them are already on your computer.</p>

<p>Windows' plain text editor it's called <i>Notepad</i>. Mac's is <i>TextEdit</i>. They're basically super-simple word processors. Plain text files usually have the file extension <kbd>.txt</kbd>.</p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> write webpages in Microsoft Word. If you open a Word file in TextEdit or Notepad you'll see a lot of gobbledygook. That's because Word files contain lots of hidden code that tells the Word program how to display the file on your screen. Plain text editors show you <em>everything</em> that's in a file, hidden code included.</p>

<p> A blank Microsoft Word document isn't really blank: it contains lots of hidden code that helps the Word program figure out how to display the document.  When you write something in plain text what you see on your screen is everything that's in the file. That's why a blank Word file takes up 29 kilobytes of memory and a blank <kbd>.txt</kbd> file takes up 0 bytes. That's also why if you open a Word <kbd>.docx</kbd> file in Notepad or TextEdit you'll see a huge page of gobbledygook: you're seeing the hidden code.</p>

<p>Notepad or TextEdit might be set to work in <dfn>rich text.</dfn> Rich text files are like Word files in that they have hidden code, and they usually end in <kbd>.rtf</kbd>. To switch to plain text you'll need to look in the settings or preferences for a <q>plain text format</q> option. Usually plain text editors show everything in a <dfn>monospace</dfn> font <kbd>(which means all the letters have the same width)</kbd> and don't use any bolding or different font sizes.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>There are lots of other plain text editors out there, many of them free. A lot of programmers use text editors that include a feature called <dfn>syntax highlighting</dfn>. This turns different bits of code into different colors so you can tell them apart easily. These colors aren't saved in the files themselves, so the files are still all plain text.</p></div>

<p>Webpage files end in <kbd>.html</kbd>, but otherwise they're just like plain text files. <kbd>index.html</kbd> should probably be the first page you make. Just create a new document in your text editor and "save" it as <kbd>index.html</kbd>.</p>
