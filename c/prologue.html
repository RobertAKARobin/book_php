&lt;h1&gt;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;By Willard Carroll Smith, Jr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince
Of a town called Bel-Air&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool and all
Shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys &amp;mdash; they were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said,
&lt;q class="mom"&gt;You're movin' with your Auntie
And Uncle in Bel-Air&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said &lt;em&gt;Fresh&lt;/em&gt;
And there were dice in the mirror.
If anything, I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, &lt;em&gt;Nah, forget it.&lt/em&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Yo, Homes! To Bel-Air!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabman,
&lt;q&gt;Yo, Homes! Smell you later!&lt;/q&gt;
I looked at my kingdom &amp;mdash; I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/pre&gt;
