<div class="example">
<p>You're on the set of the TV show <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>. Will Smith is supposed to film the theme song today, but he has a bad cold and can't talk. You're the only one who can take his place, but you don't know the lyrics.</p>
<p>Will's so sick he doesn't remember the lyrics either. He knows his secretary has them written down on a piece of paper in her filing cabinet, but he can't remember her phone number.</p>
<p>You call <kbd>4-1-1</kbd> and ask, <q>Could I have Will Smith's phone number?</q> The people at <kbd>4-1-1</kbd> look up Will's number in the phonebook and connect you to <kbd>867-5309</kbd>.</p>
<p>His secretary picks up. You say, <q>Read me the lyrics for <em>Fresh Prince</em>.</q> She goes to her filing cabinet, gets out a folder labled <q>Songs</q>, finds a document labled <q>Fresh Prince</q>, and reads it to you.</p>
<p>You memorize the lyrics and perform the song:</p>

<pre>
In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool and all
Shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
They were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said,
"You're movin' with your Auntie
And Uncle in Bel-Air"

<p>Replace Will's secretary with a computer program called a <dfn>server</dfn>, and your phone with another computer program called a <dfn>web browser</dfn>, and you've pretty much got how a website works.</p>
