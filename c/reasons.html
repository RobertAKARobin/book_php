<dt>It isn't too basic.</dt>
<dd>This book probably isn't for you if you don't know how to <q>click and drag the icon on your desktop.</q></dd>

<dt>It isn't too advanced.</dt>
<dd>This book probably isn't for you if you <em>do</em> know how to <q>compare the semantic values of the tags &lt;header&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h6&gt;.</q></dd>

<dt>It's short.</dt>
<dd>You could realistically print this out at home.</dd>

<dt>It's efficient.</dt>
<dd>You don't need to memorize the dictionary to learn Spanish. You just need to know how the grammar works and how to use the dictionary.</dd>

<dt>It teaches you only what you need to know.</dt>
<dd>Being able to build a catalytic converter won't help you drive a car. Being able to build a webserver won't help you make an awesome website.</dd>

<dt>It tells you <em>why</em>.</dt>
<dd>There's a reason for everything in web design. Knowing those reasons makes it less scary.</dd>

<dt>You don't need a computer.</dt>
<dd>Most web design books expect you to try stuff on the computer as you read. I hate that. I always end up on Facebook. My goal is for you to read this end-to-end without having to touch a computer.</dd>
