<p>Webpages contain images and videos and all kinds of stuff. But if you look at the code webpages are made from, all you'll see is a bunch of words &mdash; no images, no videos. An episode of <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> contains costumes and special effects and music, but it's all made from a script, and a script is just a bunch of words.</p>

<p>TV scripts need to be divided into lines and stage directions so actors can figure out what to do with all those words. For the same reason, webpages need to be divided into chunks, called <dfn>elements</dfn>.</p>

<code>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;An element might be a paragraph, a link, a header, an image, a button, or anything else you see on a webpage. Every element begins and ends with a &lt;div class="term"&gt;<dfn>tag</dfn>&lt;/div&gt;. Elements tell web browsers the <dfn>semantic value</dfn> of the words inside them.&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<p><i>Semantic value</i> is a fancy term for <q>the purpose of a group of words.</q> A paragraph's semantic value is that it covers a subject that's different from the subjects covered by the paragraphs around it.</p>

<p>The <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> I used above stands for <i>division</i>, as in, <q>A division of a webpage.</q> The <kbd>class=</kbd> bit is called an <dfn>attribute</dfn>, which is a fancy word for <q>a feature of something.</q> So when I write <kbd>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;</kbd>, I'm basically saying, <q>Hey, web browser, I'm starting a new divison of this webpage. It's a paragraph.</q></p>

<p>This system of "chunking" things is called <i>HTML</i>. Every single webpage is based on HTML.</p>
