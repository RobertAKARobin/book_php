<p>Webpages are made from <kbd>.html</kbd> files the way <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> is made from a script.</p>

<p>A TV script is a bunch of words. Some words are said by different people, others are yelled, whispered, or said in different scenes that are set in different places.</p>

<p>A webpage is a bunch of words. Some words might make a paragraph about a topic, others make a paragraph about a different topic, and others make a header that introduces a lot of paragraphs about one topic, or caption an image, or are part of a list.</p>

<p>In order to commun</p>

<p>Figuring out the purpose of words is called <dfn>semantics</dfn>.</p>

<p>When my teacher <q>marks up</q> my paper, it means he's writing comments on my paper: <q>This should be a new paragraph.... This is incorrect.... This is really good....</q> He isn't changing what I wrote. He's taking a chunk of what I wrote and making a suggestion about its semantic value.</p>

<p>HTML is a way of <q>marking up</q> text so that a computer can understand that different parts of your webpage's text have different purposes.</p>

<code>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;An HTML chunk is called an &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>element</dfn>&lt;/div&gt;. It begins and ends with &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>tags</dfn>&lt;/div&gt; &mdash; a start tag and an end tag.&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<p>Elements have two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have to be <i>closed</i>. Every start tag gets an end tag.</li>
<li>They have to <i>nest</i>, like directories and files. An element can't start inside another element and end outside it.</li>
</ol>
