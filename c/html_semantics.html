<p>Webpages are made from plain text files the way an episode of <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> is made from a script.</p>

<p>The point of a webpage or a TV show is to make you laugh, cry, feel a thrill, or buy something. The easiest way to do that is with words </p>

<p>When you watch a show on your TV, you're seeing an interpretation of a bunch of words. The purpose of a script is to Actors and set designers and costumers read that bunch of words (the script) and turn it into dialogue and dialogue and sets and costumes.</p>

<p>A webpage is also just a bunch of words. The words are split into chunks called <dfn>elements</dfn>. The </p>

<p>TV scripts and <kbd>.html</kbd> files are just words, split into chunks. Each chunk has a different function. Scripts are chunked into lines and stage directions. <kbd>.html</kbd> files are chunked into paragraphs, links, headers, footers, and so on. "Chunking" this way helps whoever's reading the words turn them into something <em>more</em> than words, like a TV show or a webpage.</p>

<p>Both are a way for one person to send information to a bunch of people. When we say the word <q>information</q> we usually mean the word <q>facts</q>. But it really means <q>anything you can sense that changes how you think.</q></p>

<p>A webpage's chunks are called <dfn>elements</dfn>. <dfn>semantic value</dfn>.</p>

<p>An element's <dfn>style</dfn> &mdash; how you want it to actually show up to people &mdash; is based on its function. If you're directing <em>Fresh Prince</em>, and one of Will's lines is supposed to show that he's angry, you might tell him to yell it. If part of your webpage is supposed to tell people the name of your website, you might want it to be written in bold letters at the top of your webpage. If it's a paragraph in a blog post, you probably want it to be written in normal text.</p>

<p>Chunks with the same function usually have the same form. If you want Will to yell one line that shows he's angry, you probably want him to yell <em>every</em> line that shows he's angry. You don't need to say, <q>Hey, Will, yell this,</q> every time an "angry" line comes up when you're filming <em>Fresh Prince</em>.</p>

<p>You can just tell Will once before filming starts, <q>Anytime you have an angry line, I want you to yell it.</q> If you decide you want the angry lines to have a different form, you can tell Will, <q>Actually, whenever you have an angry line I want you to Say. It. Really. Slowly.</q></p>

<p></p>

<p>A chunk's function is called its <dfn>semantic value</dfn>. (<i>Semantics</i> is the study of what words <em>do</em>, instead of just what they <em>mean</em>.) A chunk's <dfn>style</dfn> &mdash; the form you want that chunk to take &mdash; is based on its semantic value. Its form follows its function.</p>

<p>The language web browsers use to understand the semantic value of elements is called <dfn>HTML</dfn>.</p>

<p>When my teacher <q>marks up</q> my paper, it means he's writing comments on my paper: <q>This should be a new paragraph.... This is incorrect.... This is really good....</q> He isn't changing what I wrote. He's taking a chunk of what I wrote and making a suggestion about its semantic value.</p>

<p>HTML is a way of <q>marking up</q> text so that a computer can understand that different parts of your webpage's text have different purposes.</p>

<code>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;An HTML chunk is called an &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>element</dfn>&lt;/div&gt;. It begins and ends with &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>tags</dfn>&lt;/div&gt; &mdash; a start tag and an end tag.&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<p>Elements have two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have to be <i>closed</i>. Every start tag gets an end tag.</li>
<li>They have to <i>nest</i>, like directories and files. An element can't start inside another element and end outside it.</li>
</ol>-->
