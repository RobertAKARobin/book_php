<p>A webpage's code is a bunch of text broken up into chunks, based on the purpose or <dfn>semantic value</dfn> of each chunk, the way a joke can be chunked into a set-up and a punchline.</p>

<p>You do this "chunking" with a kind of code called <dfn>HTML</dfn>, which stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>.</p>

<p>When my teacher <q>marks up</q> my paper, it means he's writing comments on my paper: <q>This should be a new paragraph.... This is incorrect.... This is really good....</q> He isn't changing what I wrote. He's taking a chunk of what I wrote and making a suggestion about its semantic value.</p>

<p>The script for a movie or a play is a bunch of text broken up into lines with instructions for who says which line. Those lines might be broken up into smaller chunks with instructions for how each chunk should be said, like <q>angrily</q> or <q>to the audience.</q></p>

<p>Computers make webpages the way a director makes a movie from a script. You give the computer a bunch of text broken up into chunks. Each chunk has instructions for what the computer should do with that chunk. The computer follows the instructions to make different chunks bigger, smaller, flashy colors, put graphics in them... and then shows the result on your screen.</p>

<p>HTML is a way of <q>marking up</q> text so that a computer can understand that different parts of your webpage's text have different purposes.</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;An HTML chunk is called an &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>element</dfn>&lt;/div&gt;. It begins and ends with &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>tags</dfn>&lt;/div&gt; &mdash; a start tag and an end tag.&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>Elements have two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have to be <i>closed</i>. Every start tag gets an end tag.</li>
<li>They have to <i>nest</i>, like directories and files. An element can't start inside another element and end outside it.</li>
</ol>
