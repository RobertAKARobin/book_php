<p>If you want to have a good-looking website up and running as quickly as possible, you should stop reading and go to <code>Wordpress&#46;org</code>. Their software does all the coding and behind-the-scenes stuff for you. Write something, click a button, and they turn it into a decent finished website.</p>

<p>Wordpress is the Microsoft Word of web design. It's great for 80% of what you want to do. The other 20% is like pulling teeth. You spend hours trying to make one stupid little image move half an inch.</p>

<p>When that happens, you have to roll up your sleeves, pop the hood, and monkey around in your website's code.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to code a site from scratch. Maybe you want to write an app. Maybe you'll never actually need to write any code and just help manage some web-based product. Those are all totally different and learning to do them perfectly takes years. But they're built on the same basics, and that's all you need to know to do any of them well.</p>

<p>Code looks scary. That's the biggest thing keeping people from learning web design. My goal is to teach you just enough that code doesn't look so scary, you have a leg up on the competition, and you can easily teach yourself whatever else you need to know to get done what you want to get done.</p>
