<p>Not every keyboard in the world has the same letters. For example, on PCs you type accented characters (like <dfn>&eacute;</dfn>) completely differently from how you would on a Mac. So if you write a website including an &eacute; on a PC, it might show up all garbled on a Mac. HTML lets you prevent this from happening to the most commonly-used <dfn>special characters</dfn> by writing them a certain way: an ampersand(&amp;), followed by an abbreviation, followed by a semicolon.</p>

<h3>Draw lines matching the special characters to their HTML codes!</h3>
<div class="match">
<?php

$chars = new csv("
mdash
amp
iexcl
iquest
ldquo
rdquo
copy
trade

frac12
pi

");
echo $chars->toColumns("<ol>","</ol>",function($line){
    return array(
        "<li>&".$line[0].";</li>",
        "<li><kbd>&amp;".$line[0].";</kbd></li>"
    );
});
?>
</div>

<p>Extra credit: There are <em>lots</em> of special characters beyond these. To use them, you'll need to know their <dfn>Unicode</dfn> value. For example, <kbd>&amp;&#35;x250C;<wbr />(&amp;&#35;x0CA0;<wbr />_&amp;&#35;x0CA0;)<wbr />&amp;&#35;x2518;</kbd> makes this sweet illustration of how I look when I dance: &#x250C;( &#x0CA0;_&#x0CA0;)&#x2518;</p>
