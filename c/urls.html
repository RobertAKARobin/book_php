<p><kbd>www.willsmith.com/songs<wbr />/freshprince.html</kbd> is a <dfn>URL</dfn>. That stands for <q>Uniform Resource Locator</q>, which is a fancy way of saying 'web address'.</p>

<p><kbd>www</kbd> is a <dfn>subdomain</dfn>. It's like a phone number's extension (<q>Dial '4' for Customer Support.</q>) Every website has one. Some have lots &mdash; Craigslist has one for each region, like <kbd>newyork.craigslist&#46;com</kbd> &mdash; but most just stick with <kbd>www</kbd>.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>I'd recommend leaving subdomains alone. The <kbd>www</kbd> subdomain will be created for you automatically when you set up a website. Other subdomains can cost extra and are harder for people to remember. If you have <kbd>hello.website&#46;com</kbd> set up but not <kbd>www.website&#46;com</kbd> a lot of visitors will get "page not found" errors and never come back.</p></div>

<p>The domain and subdomain together make the URL's <dfn>base</dfn>. After that comes the <dfn>path</dfn>: directions to the webpage you want. Anything with a slash (<kbd>/</kbd>) after it is a <dfn>directory</dfn>, which is a fancy way of saying 'folder'. At the end of the URL is the webpage's file name.</p>

<p>You can name a file or directory whatever you want using <em>alphanumeric</em> characters (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9), undercores (<kbd>_</kbd>), and hyphens (<kbd>-</kbd>). The <kbd>.html</kbd> at the end of <kbd>freshprince.html</kbd> is a <dfn>file extension</dfn>, which says what type of file it is. Every type of file has its own special extension. Webpages are written in a language called HTML, which is why they have that extension.</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>People like to say <q>backslash</q> when they're reading URLs. That drives me crazy. A <em>slash</em> is <kbd>/</kbd> and a <em>backslash</em> is <kbd>\</kbd>. They go different directions and do completely different things in the computer world. You'll almost never find a backslash in a URL.</p>
