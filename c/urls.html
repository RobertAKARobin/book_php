<p><code>www.wsmith1.com/raps/freshprince.html</code> is a <dfn>URL</dfn>, which is the fancy name for "web address."</p>

<p><code>www</code> is a <dfn>subdomain</dfn>. It's like a phone number's extension (as in, <q>Dial '4' for Customer Support</q>). Every site has at least one. Some have lots &mdash; Craigslist has one for each region it serves, like <code>newyork.craigslist&#46;com</code> &mdash; but most just stick with <code>www</code>.</p>

<p>The domain and subdomain together are the URL's <dfn>base</dfn>. After that comes the <dfn>path</dfn> &mdash; the directions to the webpage you want. Anything followed by a slash (<code>/</code>) is a <dfn>directory</dfn>, which is the fancy name for a folder. The path usually ends in the name of the webpage you want.</p>

<p>When I type <code>www.wsmith1.com/raps/freshprince.html</code> into my web browser, it's like I'm calling <code>976-4841</code>, Will's secretary picks up, and I say, <q>I want you to open your filing cabinet, look for a folder called <q>raps</q>, look in there for a file called <q>freshprince.html,</q> and then read it to me.</q></p>

<p>You can name a file or directory whatever you want <em>alphanumeric</em> characters (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9), undercores (<code>_</code>), and hyphens (<code>-</code>). The <code>.html</code> at the end of <code>freshprince.html</code> is a <dfn>file extension</dfn>, which says what type of file it is. Every type of file has its own special extension. Webpages are written in a language called HTML, which is why they have that extension.</p>

<aside>
<p>People like to say <q>backslash</q> when they're reading URLs. That drives me crazy. A <em>slash</em> is <code>/</code> and a <em>backslash</em> is <code>\</code>. They do completely different things in the computer world, and you'll almost never find a backslash in a URL.</p>
