<p><code>www.wsmith1.com/raos/freshprince.html</code> is a <dfn>URL</dfn>, which is the fancy name for "web address."</p>

<p><code>8675309&#46;com</code> is a <dfn>domain</dfn>. It's like a website's phone number. <code>www</code> is a <dfn>subdomain</dfn>. It's like a phone number's extension (as in, <q>Dial '4' for Customer Support</q>). Some sites have lots of subdomains &mdash; Craigslist has one for each region it serves, like <code>newyork.craigslist&#46;com</code> &mdash; but most just stick with <code>www</code>.</p>

<p>The domain and subdomain together are the <dfn>base URL</dfn>. After that comes the <dfn>path</dfn> &mdash; the directions to the file you want. Anything followed by a slash (<code>/</code>) is a <dfn>directory</dfn>, which is the fancy name for a folder. The path usually ends in the name of the file you want.</p>

<p>So when I type <code>www.8675309.com/raps/freshprince.html</code> into my web browser, it's like I'm calling a secretary at <em>867-5309</em> and saying, <q>I want you to open your filing cabinet, look for a folder called <q>raps</q>, and look in there for a file called <q>freshprince.html.</q></q></p>

<p>You can name a file or directory whatever you want <em>alphanumeric</em> characters (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9), undercores (<code>_</code>), and hyphens (<code>-</code>). The <code>.html</code> at the end of <code>freshprince.html</code> is a <dfn>file extension</dfn>, which says what type of file it is. Every type of file has its own special extension.</p>

<aside>
<p>People like to say <q>backslash</q> when they're reading URLs. That drives me crazy. A <em>slash</em> is <code>/</code> and a <em>backslash</em> is <code>\</code>. They do completely different things in the computer world, and you'll almost never find a backslash in a URL.</p>
