<p>If you were around in the days of dial-up Internet then you remember being able to actually hear your computer dial numbers through your phone line. After that, you'd hear a bunch of weird buzzing and static-y sounds. That was your computer "talking" to another computer.</p>
-->

<p>Computers talk to each other one <dfn>bit</dfn> at a time. Computer memory is made of tiny switches that are either "on" or "off", like light switches. A <i>bit</i> is an electric signal that tells your computer to turn one of those switches on or off. This changes how electricity flows through your computer and makes it do something like change the color of a pixel on your screen.</p>

<p>Your computer displays webpages because the files it gets from servers tell it to turn its switches on and off in a certain way, which makes the pixels on your screen light up a certain way, which makes a pattern of lights that your eyes see as a webpage.</p>

<p>Verizon and Comcast might advertise <q>50 Mbps download speeds,</q> which means they can let your computer talk with others at 50 <em>mega-bits per second</em>. One mega-bit is 1,000 bits. One letter of the alphabet usually takes up 8 bits (called a <dfn>byte</dfn>), so 50 Mbps works out to over 6,000 letters per second.</p>

<p>This system of talking is called <dfn>HTTP</dfn>. That's why you see <code>http://</code> before so many web addresses: it tells your web browser to talk to other computers with HTTP. (There are a bunch of other Internet protocols but you'll never see most of them.)</p>

<div class="aside">
<p><i>HTTP</i> stands for <q>Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</q> <i>Hypertext</i> is a word nobody uses anymore that means <q>text with links in it.</q></p>
<p>You don't need to say <q>h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash</q> when you're telling someone a URL. Web browsers add in the <code>http://</code> automatically, so saying that is like always calling him <q>Will Smith</q> instead of just <q>Will.</q></p>
