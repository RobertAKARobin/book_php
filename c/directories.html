<p>Map out a website and all of the files and directories it contains and you get a <dfn>directory tree</dfn>. For a computer to open a file, it needs directions through the directory tree.</p>

<p>A directory can contain any number of files and <dfn>subdirectories</dfn>. They're its <dfn>children</dfn>. Each child has only one <dfn>parent</dfn>: you can put two files in one directory but you can't put one file in two directories. They have to <dfn>nest</dfn>.</p>

<p>Directories are like rooms in a museum. Each room usually has a couple pieces of art in it (files), and sometimes smaller rooms (subdirectories) with even <em>smaller</em> rooms inside them. Each room has a door, and all the doors and pieces of art have labels.</p>

<p>To make the computer look at a piece of art (<i>open a file</i>), tell it the label. To make it go through a door into a room, tell it the door's label followed by a slash (<kbd>/</kbd>). On the back of each door is the label <q><kbd>..</kbd></q>, so to make the computer go back <em>out</em> of a room you'd write <kbd>../</kbd>.</p>

<p>An <dfn>absolute</dfn> URL tells a computer how to get to a file from any point in the Internet, like <kbd>www.wsmith1&#46;com/movies<wbr />/meninblack.html</kbd>. A relative URL tells a computer how to get to a file from whatever directory it's looking at right now. For example, if the computer's looking at <kbd>wsmith1.com/raps<wbr />/new.html</kbd>, the relative URL for <kbd>meninblack.html</kbd> would be <kbd>../movies/meninblack.html</kbd>. </p>

<!--<p>It's the difference between telling someone, <q>Go through the next three rooms, make a right, and the Mona Lisa's on your left,</q> and saying, <q>The Mona Lisa is in France, in Paris, in the Louvre Museum, on Floor 1, in Room 6, on the western wall.</q></p>-->
