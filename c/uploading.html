<p>If you have a domain and a server you've got your phone and phone number. Now you need a reson for people to call you: you need to <dfn>upload</dfn> files to your website.</p>

<aside>
<p><dfn>Loading</dfn> is copying data from one place to another. <dfn>Uploading</dfn> is copying <em>to</em> the Internet; <dfn>downloading</dfn> is copying <em>from</em> the Internet. People always get this wrong. For example:</p>
<p><q>I'm going to download the photos of Little Timmy's birthday party to Facebook.</q></p>
<p><q>Ooh, Karen just put the photos of Little Timmy's birthday party on Facebook! I'll go upload them to my computer.</q></p>

<p>Most hosts let you upload stuff via a <dfn title="Such as you might create in Visual Basic to track a killer's IP address">GUI</dfn>, which is pronounced <q>gooey</q> and means <em>Graphical User Interface</em>. An <dfn>interface</dfn> is a program that makes it easier to work with some other program. A <em>graphical</em> interface uses graphics, probably because whatever you're working with is really hard to understand, like a server.</p>

<p>When you go to your local Chinese take-out restaurant the big menu above the cash register with photos of all the food is a GUI for people who don't speak Chinese. Your web browser is a GUI for the Internet.</p>

<p>Your hosting service might use a GUI called cPanel (as in "control panel"), Plesk, or DirectAdmin. They're all more-or-less the same thing: a webpage that lets you create, edit, and upload files through your web browser, the same way you'd create, edit, or upload posts or pictures on Facebook.</p>

<aside>
<p>I actually usually use an <em>FTP client</em> called FileZilla to upload files to my site. It makes my site's host show up on my desktop so I can drag-and-drop files into it (like DropBox, if you've used that). It's quicker than my host's GUI but harder to set up.</p>
