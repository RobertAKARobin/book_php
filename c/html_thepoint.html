<p>The way you <dfn>style</dfn> text depends on its <i>semantics</i> &mdash; that is, the way text looks depends on what it means.</p>

<p>If I'm writing a book of awful jokes, I might want it to look like this:</p>

<figure>
<div class="joke">
<div class="setup">What does a cloud wear on its butt?</div>
<div class="punchline">Thunderpants.</div>
</div>
<div class="joke">
<div class="setup">What do you call a cow with no legs?</div>
<div class="punchline">Ground beef.</div>
</div>
</figure>
