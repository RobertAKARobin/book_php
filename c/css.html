<p>You style in a language called <dfn>CSS</dfn>, which is completely different from HTML. You can see it in that <code>style="text-decoration:underline;"</code> bit before. CSS can do <strong>all kinds of things</strong>. It can make elements big, small, blink, shadowed, change color when you hover over them, and much, much more.</p>

<p>Let's say I wanted all of my <code>div</code> elements to be underlined. You've seen one way to do that already:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;<span style="text-decoration:underline">Hamlet's Soliloquoy, by Bill Shakespeare.</span>&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;<span style="text-decoration:underline">To be, or not to be: that is the question.</span>&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>If I have a lot of <code>div</code> elements, writing <code>"text-decoration:underline;"</code> in all of them is going to be a huge pain. Plus, if I decide I don't want them underlined I'd have to go through and delete every occurrence of <code>"text-decoration:underline;"</code></p>

<p>Fortunately, CSS lets us use <dfn>stylesheets</dfn>. ('CSS' stands for <q>Cascading Style Sheets</q>) A stylesheet looks like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
div
{
text-decoration:underline;
}
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>

<p>This takes <strong>every</strong> <code>div</code> element and underlines it. Now I only need to change one piece of code to change the style of every <code>div</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>div</code> is called a CSS <dfn>selector</dfn> because it <em>selects</em> to which elements the CSS <dfn>rules</dfn> are being applied. A <em>rule</em> consists of a <dfn>property</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn>. In this case there's only one selector with one rule, but you can have any number. The format's always the same:</p>

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
selector1
{
property-a:value-w;
property-b:value-x;
}
selector2
{
property-c:value-y;
property-d:value-z;
}
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
