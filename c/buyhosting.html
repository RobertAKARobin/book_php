<div class="example">
<p>Will's phone is ringing off the hook. Half the calls get "busy" signals because he's talking to someone else. Plus, he's not always around to answer the phone &mdash; he has to eat, sleep, and go stand in line at the DMV.</p>

<p>To keep up with demand for his raps, Bill buys a bunch of phones, hooks them up to receive calls made to <em>867-5309</em>, and hires a dozen other professional rappers to answer them.</p>

<p><dfn>Hosting services</dfn> are businesses that rent you space on super-fast computers that were made just to run servers. Usually they keep hundreds of these computers in huge underground "server farms."</p>

<p>Hosting services usually sell domains, too. You don't have to change your website's domain to change hosts. You probably shouldn't anyway since domains are such an important part of online branding. (Imagine if Google moved to a domain other than <code>google&#46;com</code>)</p>

<p>Hosting is cheap: I pay about $6 a month. One reason it's so cheap is that my website's on a <em>shared server</em> that also serves several other people's websites. If I was really paranoid about security, or was expecting my site to get a million views every day, I might want to pay more to use faster computers or use  a <em>dedicated server</em> that would serve only my site.</p>

<p>But I'm just an average guy. If I Google "web hosting" anything on the first page of results will probably suit my needs.</p>

<aside>
<p>Just about every host will automatically set up the <code>www</code> subdomain for you. Other subdomains usually cost extra, and I'd recommend leaving them alone. Yesterday I tried to go to <code>website&#46;com</code> and got a "page not found" error because the genius who runs the site set up <code>hello.website&#46;com</code> but not <code>www.website&#46;com</code>.</p>
