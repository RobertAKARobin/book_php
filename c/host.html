<p>If I buy the domain <code>RobinIsACoolDude.com</code> and immediately open that up in a web browser I'll get a "page not found" error. A domain without a <dfn>server</dfn> is like a phone number without a person to answer it. A server without a <dfn>host</dfn> computer is like a secretary without a phone.</p>

<p><i>Host</i> really just means <q>a computer that's connected to the Internet.</q> But when you're talking about web design a host is the computer storing your website's files and running its server. Your server is the computer program that "lives" on your host and answers requests for the files inside it.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>To recap: The <dfn>domain</dfn> is the phone number. The <dfn>server</dfn> is the secretary. The <dfn>host</dfn> is the secretary's office, containing a phone and a filing cabinet. The <dfn>URL</dfn> is the number you're calling and what you're saying to the secretary. Every time you call is a new <dfn>request</dfn>.</p></div>

<p>You can run a server on pretty much any computer, even your own personal laptop, which is called <dfn>self-hosting</dfn>. I don't know anyone who actually does that, because if you're self-hosting and turn off your computer, your whole website goes down. If you're using your computer to watch a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> marathon it will serve requests really slowly.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>There are lots of different server programs &mdash; <em>Apache</em>, <em>Oracle</em>, and so on. They can be really hard to install and keep running, and how exactly they work is pretty complicated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like a lot of things in web design, you don't need to know <em>how</em> they work in order to work <em>with</em> them. What I've talked about so far is all you need to know until you get into <em>really advanced</em> web design.</p></div>
