<p>If I buy the domain <kbd>RobinIsACoolDude.com</kbd> and try to go there in my web browser I'll get a "page not found" error. A domain without a <dfn>server</dfn> is like a phone number without a person to answer it. A domain without a <dfn>host</dfn> is like a phone number without a phone.</p>

<p><i>Host</i> really just means <q>a computer that's connected to the Internet.</q> But when you're talking about web design <i>host</i> usually means the computer storing your website's files and running its <i>server</i>. A server is the program that "lives" on your host and answers requests for the files inside it. (It <q>serves them up.</q>) You can't have a server without a host, so a lot of people use the words to mean the same thing.</p>

<div class="example"><p>Quick review: The <dfn>domain</dfn> is (basically) the phone number. The <dfn>server</dfn> is the secretary. The <dfn>host</dfn> is the secretary's office, containing a phone and a filing cabinet. The <dfn>URL</dfn> is the number you're calling and what file you're asking the secretary to read to you. Every time you call is a new <dfn>request</dfn>.</p></div>

<p>You can run a server on pretty much any computer, even your own personal laptop, which is called <i>self-hosting</i>. It's not really a good idea: if you're self-hosting and turn off your computer, your whole website goes down. If you're using your computer to watch a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> marathon it will serve requests really slowly.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>There are lots of different server programs &mdash; <em>Apache</em>, <em>Oracle</em>, and so on. How exactly they work is <em>complicated</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like a lot of things in web design, you don't need to know <em>how</em> they work in order to work <em>with</em> them. What I've talked about so far is all you need to know until you get into <em>really advanced</em> web design.</p></div>
