<div class="example">
<p>Will Smith wants to hire someone to turn his life story into a website <em>(not true)</em>. I'm broke and would love the job <em>(very true)</em>.</p>
<p>I pick up my phone and dial <code>976-4841</code> (that's <code>WSMITH-1</code>). His secretary picks up. I say, <q>Hey, I want to make Will's website. Could you tell me about where he was born and raised?</q></p>
<p>The secretary goes to a filing cabinet, gets out a folder marked <em>Life</em>, and flips through it for a piece of paper labled <em>Early Years</em>. She reads it over the phone to me while I write it down.</p>
</div>

<p>Replace Will's secretary with a computer program called a <dfn>server</dfn>, and my phone with a <dfn>web browser</dfn> (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Internet Explorer), and you've basically got how a website works.</p>

<p>You enter <code>www.wsmith1.com/life/earlyyears.html</code> into your web browser's address bar. Your computer "dials" <code>wsmith1.com</code>.  A server at <code>wsmith1.com</code> picks up and sees that you want it to look in a folder called <code>life</code> for a file called <code>earlyyears.html</code>. It reads the file back to your computer, and your computer displays the file on your screen.</p>

<p>Every webpage is a file on a computer somewhere. That file's kept in a folder. That's all any website is &mdash; a bunch of files and folders, just like the files and folders on your personal computer.</p>

<p>If your computer was big enough to hold all of Amazon&#46;com's files, and Amazon let you download them, you could browse Amazon on your computer the way you browse your school essays or cat photos.</p>
