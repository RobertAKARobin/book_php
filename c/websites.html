<div class="example">
<p>In 5 minutes Will Smith is supposed to go on stage and perform a new rap song. But he has a bad cold and can't talk. It's too late to cancel the concert. I have to take his place.</p>
<p>I don't know the lyrics, so I dial <code>976-4841</code> (that's <code>WSMITH-1</code>). Will's secretary picks up. I say, <q>Read me the lyrics for Will's new song.</q> She goes to her filing cabinet, gets out a folder labled <q>Raps</q>, flips through it for a document labled <q>New</q>, and reads it over the phone to me.</p>
<p>I memorize the lyrics she read me, go on stage, and perform the song.</p>
</div>

<p>Replace Will's secretary with a computer called a <dfn>server</dfn>, and my phone with a <dfn>web browser</dfn> (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Internet Explorer), and you've basically got how a website works.</p>

<ol>
<li>You enter <code>www.wsmith1.com/raps/new.html</code> into your web browser's address bar</li>
<li>Your computer "dials" <code>wsmith1.com</code>.</li>
<li>A server at <code>wsmith1.com</code> picks up.</li>
<li>The server sees that you want it to look in a folder called <code>raps</code> for a file called <code>new.html</code>.</li>
<li>It reads the file back to your computer.</li>
<li>Your web browser reads the file like a movie script: lines of text with suggestions of how to "say" (or display) each line.</li>
<li>Your web browser displays the file on your computer screen as a webpage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every web<dfn>page</dfn> is a file on a computer somewhere. That file's kept in a folder. That's all any web<dfn>site</dfn> is &mdash; a bunch of files and folders, just like the files and folders on your personal computer.</p>
