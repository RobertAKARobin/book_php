<p><em>Fresh Prince</em> is made from a script. By itself, a script doesn't do anything. It's just a bunch of words. You need actors, set designers, and cameramen to <em>interpret</em> the script and turn it into a TV show.</p>

<p>In the same way, webpages are made from code. By itself, code doesn't do anything. It's just a bunch of text. You need a <dfn>web browser</dfn> &mdash; like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari &mdash; to <em>interpret</em> the code and turn it into a webpage.</p>

<p>When I "go" to a web address, I'm actually "getting" a bunch of code from another computer. My web browser reads the code like an actor would read a script, using it to figure out what it should show on my computer screen. This is called <i>rendering</i>.</p>

<p>A <dfn>server</dfn> is sort-of the opposite of a web browser. It's a computer program that takes code stored on one computer and "serves" it to other computers (its <dfn>clients</dfn>).</p>

<p>That code is stored in a file in a folder on a computer somewhere, the way you store documents and photos in files in folders on a personal computer.</p>

<p>That's all webpages are: text in files in folders on computers. Making a webpage is a lot like writing anything else on a computer. In some ways it's easier.</p>
