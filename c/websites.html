<p>Replace Will's secretary with a computer program called a <dfn>server</dfn> and your phone with a <dfn>web browser</dfn>, and you've basically got how a website works:</p>

<div class="example">
<ol>
<li>You enter<code>willsmith.com/songs/freshprince.html</code> in your web browser's address bar.</li>
<li>Another computer looks up <code>willsmith.com</code> in the Internet's phone book to find its phone number.</li>
<li>That other computer tells your computer that <code>willsmith.com</code> has the number <code>86.75.30.9</code>.</li>
<li>Your computer dials <code>86.75.30.9</code>. The computer with that number picks up.</li>
<li><em>That</em> computer looks for a folder called <code>songs</code>, and looks inside the folder for a file called <code>freshprince.html</code>.</li>
<li>It finds the file and reads it back to your computer.</li>
<li>Your web browser follows the instructions in the file to display it on your computer screen as a webpage.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>A <dfn>web browser</dfn> is like your computer's phone. You might have <i>Chrome</i> by Google, <i>Safari</i> by Apple, <i>Firefox</i> by Mozilla, or <i>Internet Explorer</i> by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Every web<dfn>page</dfn> is just a file on a computer somewhere. That file's kept in a folder. That's all any web<dfn>site</dfn> is &mdash; a bunch of files and folders, just like the files and folders on your personal computer.</p>
