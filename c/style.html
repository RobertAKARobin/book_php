<div class="example">
<p>I'm trying to figure out the costumes for <em>Hamlet</em>. I ask Bill to mark up the script with style suggestions.</p>
<p>When I get the script back, it's a hundred times longer. The content isn't any different &mdash; every time a character speaks a line, Bill writes what they're wearing. For example:</p>

<pre>
BERNARDO <em>(Wearing armor and carrying a spear)</em> Who's there?

FRANCISCO <em>(Wearing armor and carrying a spear)</em> Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO <em>(Wearing armor and carrying a spear)</em> Long live the king!
</pre>

<p>I write back, <q>Hey, Bill, think you could just write on a different piece of paper what the costumes should be for each <em>type</em> of person?</q></p>
<p>The next version of the script is back to normal length, with all the costume suggestions listed on a separate page: <q>Each guard wears armor and carries a spear.</q></p>
</div>

<p><dfn>Styling</dfn> is figuring out how you want elements to look. For example, you'd probably want a header to stand out from whatever it introduces, so you might just underline it, or you might make its font huge and orange and bold or something.</p>
