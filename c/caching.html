<p>Bill has made more changes to <em>Hamlet</em>. I ask him to send me the new script. He includes some new pictures, but in a lot of places he's written things like, <q>Use that old drawing of Hamlet's castle that I sent you last time.</q><p>

<p>Server requests are <dfn>expensive</dfn>, which in computer terms means they take up a lot of power and memory, both for the server and the computer making the request. One big request or a ton of little requests can both seriously bog down a computer.</p>

<p>So web browsers <dfn>cache</dfn> some things &mdash; after loading a file it saves a copy of the file in a special directory called a cache (pronounced <q>cash,</q> like money). That way if your browser sees the file's URL again it can just open up the copy it has saved instead of having to download it.</p>

<p>This isn't something you have to build into your website's code: web browsers do it automatically, mostly for images and videos.</p>

<aside>Sometimes a file is changed but your web browser keeps showing the old version it has cached. Other times your cache gets so full of files that it starts to slow down your computer. In either case it's good to <dfn>clear your cache</dfn>, which you can usually do from your browser's settings.</aside>
