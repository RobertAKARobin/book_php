<p>Every computer pixel contains three lights: one red, one green*, and one blue. To make a pixel a certain color you tell the computer how bright each light should be, from <code>000</code> (off) to <code>255</code> (full-blast). For example, blue would be <code>000,000,255</code>, purple <code>255,000,255</code>, and yellow <code>255,255,000</code>. The problem is computers only give you 2 characters to write this value, and the biggest value you can make using regular <dfn>decimal</dfn> integers (with 10 possible values, 0-9) is 99.</p>

<p><dfn>Hexadecimal</dfn> (or <dfn>hex</dfn>) integers have 16 possible values, letting you get up to 255 in 2 characters. Hex uses the first 6 letters of the alphabet, A-F, to represent the numbers 10-15. So 0 is <code>00</code>, 15 is <code>0F</code>, 16 is <code>10</code>, 160 is <code>A0</code>, and 255 is <code>FF</code>.</p>

<h3>Draw lines matching the colors to their hexadecimal values!</h3>

<aside>*It's green instead of yellow because computer light is "additive" whereas natural light is "subtractive." I don't really know what that means, but it's science.</aside>
<p>Extra credit: What colors can you make from words using only hex characters? For example, <code>0ff1ce</code> is sea green, <code>beaded</code> is soft purple, <code>c0ffee</code> is a very light blue, <code>defec8</code> is kind of a pastel yellow-green.</p>
