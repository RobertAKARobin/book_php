<p>You can view a <kbd>.html</kbd> file as a webpage in your web browser without being connected to the Internet. Just drag the <kbd>.html</kbd> file onto your web browser's icon on your computer. Your web browser will open the file, read all its code, and display it as a webpage. This is really handy when you make changes to your code because you can see how they look without having to upload anything to the Internet.</p>

<p>If your file is already open in a web browser, just <q>save</q> your <kbd>.html</kbd> file in your plain text editor and then <q>refresh</q> the page in your web browser. The webpage will show any changes you've made.</p>

<p>When you do this, the URL in your address bar will be something like <kbd>file:/&#47;&#47;desktop/index.html</kbd>. The <kbd>file:/&#47;/</kbd> tells the computer to look inside a <dfn>local</dfn> directory called <kbd>desktop</kbd> for <kbd>index.html</kbd>.</p>

<p><i>Local</i> means <q>on whatever computer you're using.</q> So if someone on <em>another</em> computer tries to go to <kbd>file:/&#47;&#47;desktop/index.html</kbd>, <em>their</em> computer will look inside <em>itself</em> for a directory called <kbd>desktop</kbd> with a file called <kbd>index.html</kbd> inside <em>it</em>.</p>

<p>For other people to see your website, you'll need to upload it to your host and they'll need its <kbd>http://</kbd> URL.</p>
