<p>You don't need to be connected to the Internet to view a <code>.html</code> file as if it was a webpage on the Internet. Just drag the <code>.html</code> onto your web browser's icon and your web browser will open and display it. This is really handy when you're writing a webpage. You can make changes to your code and see how they look without having to upload anything to the Internet.</p>

<p>If your file is already open in a web browser, you can make things go even faster. "Save" your <code>.html</code> file in your plain text editor after you've made changes, and then <em>refresh</em> the page in your web browser.</p>

<p>When you do this, the URL in your address bar will be something like <code>file:/&#47;&#47;myComputer/documents/index.html</code>. This means the webpage is <dfn>local</dfn> to your computer &mdash; that is, whoever's operating your computer is the only person who can see it.  If you were to go to that <code>file:/&#47;/</code> URL on another computer's web browser, the web browser would look on <em>that</em> computer for the <code>index.html</code> file and not find anything. The webpage won't be "live" on the Internet until you upload it to a host.</p>
