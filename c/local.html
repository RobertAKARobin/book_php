<p>You can view a <code>.html</code> file as a webpage in your web browser without being connected to the Internet. Just drag the <code>.html</code> file onto your web browser's icon. Your web browser will open the file, read all its code, and display it as a webpage. This is really handy when you make changes to your code because you can see how they look without having to upload anything to the Internet.</p>

<p>If your file is already open in a web browser, just <q>save</q> your <code>.html</code> file in your plain text editor and then <q>refresh</q> the page in your web browser. The webpage will show any changes you've made.</p>

<p>When you do this, the URL in your address bar will be something like <code>file:/&#47;&#47;desktop/index.html</code>. The <code>file:/&#47;/</code> tells the computer to look inside a <dfn>local</dfn> directory called <code>desktop</code> for <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<p><i>Local</i> means <q>on whatever computer you're using.</q> So if someone on <em>another</em> computer tries to go to <code>file:/&#47;&#47;desktop/index.html</code>, <em>their</em> computer will look inside <em>itself</em> for a directory called <code>desktop</code> with a file called <code>index.html</code> inside it.</p>

<p>For other people to see your website, you'll need to upload it to your host and they'll need its <code>http://</code> URL.</p>
