<p>There are two sides to web design. <i>Server-side</i> or <dfn>back-end</dfn> design is more about <i>information</i>. <i>Client-side</i> or <dfn>front-end</dfn> design is more about <i>intent</i>.</p>

<p>When someone says <q>information</q> they usually mean <q>facts</q>. But the word really means <q>anything a person can read, hear, or sense that changes how they experience things, at least a little bit.</q></p>

<p>People send you information because they <i>intend</i> for you to experience things a certain way. They want you to laugh, cry, agree with them, or buy something.</p>

<p>The easiest way to send information is with words. That's what the people who invented the Internet had in mind: sharing plain text. It's still what the Internet does best. But </p>

<p>If an actor yells <q>I'm so happy</q> with a smile on their face, it's a lot more convincing than if they say it in a robot voice. If my website says <q>Limited time only!</q> in big flashing letters, it's more obvious that I really want you to buy something than if I write it in regular black letters.</p>

<p><dfn>Content writers</dfn> write words.</p>

<p><dfn>Front-end designers</dfn> write the code that makes your web browser show the words in big flashing letters.</p>

<p><dfn>Back-end designers</dfn> write the code that lets a server send that other code and the words to your web browser in the first place.</p>

<p>Every good front-end designer knows some back-end design, and the other way around. Most content writers don't know a thing about either: updating your Facebook status is writing content.</p>

<div class="aside"><p>There are also <dfn>developers</dfn>, but the difference between a developer and a designer depends on who you ask. I say developers build things that work, and designers make them work <em>well</em>.</p></div>

<p>You really need to know front-end design before you can do back-end design, and it's all you need to know to code a great-looking website from scratch.</p>
