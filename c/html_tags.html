<pre>&lt;div&gt;div is the most common HTML element. It's just a "division" of a webpage.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;You can make different kinds of divs by giving them different &lt;div class="define"&gt;<dfn>classes</dfn>&lt;/div&gt;. You can name a class whatever you want using alphanumeric characters. You only have to name the class in the div's start tag.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing classes for every paragraph would get really old. HTML has a bunch of elements built-in besides div that cover the semantic chunks documents are most likely to have, like &lt;dfn&gt;<dfn>p</dfn>&lt;/dfn&gt; for "paragraph" or &lt;dfn&gt;<dfn>dfn</dfn>&lt;dfn&gt; for words that need to be "defined."&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There are over 100 HTML elements, but web designers use 30 of them for nearly everything. Their names are supposed to give hints about what they do (like <i>p</i> for <i>paragraph</i>). They all have start tags and end tags, and you can give any of them classes.</p>

<p>There are a few goofy elements that don't need end tags, called <dfn>self-closing</dfn> elements. The one you're most likely to use is <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>, for <q>image.</q> That slash in the tag closes the element: you can't put text <em>inside</em> an image, so there's no point having start and end tags.</p>

<pre>&lt;!--The other goofy element is the comment. Web browsers skip them: they don't show up on webpages. This is really nice for leaving notes to yourself in your code, and for hiding elements while you're editing your webpage so you can experiment with different things. You don't have to delete code, you just "comment it out."--&gt;
