<div class="example">
<p>Will's phone is ringing off the hook, and his secretary is overwhelmed. Half the calls get "busy" signals because she's already talking to someone. Plus, she's not always around to answer the phone.</p>

<p>To keep up, Will buys a bunch of phones, hooks them up to receive calls made to <code>976-4841</code>, and hires more secretaries.</p>

<p><dfn>Hosting services</dfn> are businesses that rent you space on super-fast computers that are made just to run servers. Usually they keep hundreds of these computers in huge underground "server farms."</p>

<p>Hosting services usually sell domains, too. You don't have to change your website's domain to change hosts, you just change your website's DNS settings so nameservers send requests to the new IP address.</p>

<p>Hosting is cheap: I pay about $6 a month. One reason it's so cheap is that my website's uses a <em>shared server</em> with several other people's websites. If I was really paranoid about security, or was expecting my site to get a million views every day, I might want to pay more to use faster computers or use  a <em>dedicated server</em> that would serve only my site.</p>

<p>But I'm just an average guy. If I Google "web hosting" anything on the first page of results will probably suit my needs.</p>

<p>Just about every host will automatically set up the <code>www</code> subdomain for you. Other subdomains usually cost extra, and I'd recommend leaving them alone. Yesterday I tried to go to <code>website&#46;com</code> and got a "page not found" error because the genius who runs the site set up another subdomain instead of<code>www.website&#46;com</code>.</p>
