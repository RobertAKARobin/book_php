Overview
    What is a website under the hood?
    How does it work?
    How do you set one up?
    How do you write one?
        HTML/CSS
    Touch on JS and PHP
    
    CMS vs coding from scratch

What is a website?
    A folder, just like you'd find on your computer
        Contains folders (directories) and files
    *
        Open robertgfthomas.com in FZ
        
    To "own" a website, you need two things
        A domain
            Like www.google.com
        ...and a server
    
    How websites work
        Will Smith lives at 123 Bel-Air Ave
            Send letter to 123 Bel-Air ave
                "Hey, I want the script for Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"
                Whoever's at 123 Bel-Air Ave gets address
                Sends me the text of Fresh Prince
        Website:
            Lives at www.123belairavenue.com/freshprince.txt
            Your computer sends request to www.willsmith.com
                "Hey, send me whatever's at freshprince.txt"
                A computer at the address gets the message
                Sends back freshprince.txt
        Server
            Computer's called a server because it "serves" content to you
            Whoever controls the server at your site's address is your Host
                Using your own computer is self-hosting
                What Will Smith is doing when receiving letters and filling orders
        What if he goes on vacation?
            Or you tell all your friends about this sweet script
                Now he's getting more orders than he can fill
            Will moves and turns 123 Bel-Air Ave into a factory
                (In real life easier to just change address, but bear with me)
        Server
            No longer self-hosting
            Set up computers especially for receiving and sending web requests
            Hosting is cheap
                I don't know anyone who self-hosts
    
    Upload to a website
        Two methods:
            FTP
            Online editors
        FTP
            File transfer protocol
            Usually an app that sits on your computer
            Drag-and-drop
    *
        robertgfthomas.com/blah.jpg doesn't exist
        Drag and drop it
        Now it exists
        
    Online editor
        What people are probably used to
    *
        robertgfthomas.com/blah.txt doesn't exist
        Create file at Inmotionhosting and write something
        Now it exists

    Index
        Will Smith
            If you just send an envelope to 123 Bel-Air, he won't know what to send you
                So if you don't know what scripts are available, you're out of luck
            What would be REALLY nice is a catalogue of scripts
                Send an envelope, he sends you a catalogue of what's available
        On website:
            If you just go to facebook.com you won't see anyone's profile
                Need to specify facebook.com/robertgfthomas
            Fortunately, Facebook gives you a way of getting there
        Websites have indexes
            The "main page" of a website
            It's called an Index
                Purpose is to give you a way of navigating to all of the different pages on site
        Servers expect every directory to have an index
            Looks for something called "index.html"
            So essential it won't even usually show "index.html" in URL
    *
        Show robertgfthomas.com
        Show robertgfthomas.com/index.html
            Same thing
            
            Indexes so important that if you haven't made one, server will make one for you
    *
        Show robertgfthomas.com/anatomyofawebsite/class online
        Shows default index
        Change welcome.html to "index.html"
        Reload
        
        Conclusion: first page you make on site should probably be index.html

        
Actually making a site
    Local files
        In this class a lot of what I show isn't online
        When you're testing a site, you can just drag and drop it onto your web browser
    *
        Drag and drop welcome.html

        Super convenient!
        Can tell it's local because of file:/// in URL, instead of HTTP
            HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is what computers and servers use to talk to each other
            If someone tries to open file:/// URL their computer will just within itself

    What application used to make site?
        A plain text editor
            Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, lots of others available
            If you see lots of bolding or different sizes or fonts that aren't ugly, probably rich text

    *
        Compare welcome.docx to welcome.html
        Drag and drop welcome.html onto Chrome
            Looks heinous
        Open as plain text
            Looks heinous
            
    All you need to make a site is a plain text editor and a web browser
        Why I do everything in HTML now
        
Writing a site
    Will Smith
        Want to do your own production of Fresh Prince
            He sent you a script for Fresh Prince
    *
        Open belair.txt in Chrome
        
        Missing a lot of meaning. You can see the words, but they're just words
            Scripts need stage directions, intonation directions, etc
            
    Websites are written in HTML, which does that
        Hypertext Markup Language
    ??
        What does "markup" mean?
            When you mark up a paper, you're writing comments or instructions
                Not changing content of paper itself
                
    What HTML looks like
    *
        Open blank.html
            (Ignore blank.css)

        Made of "elements"
            An element is a box that tells you what's inside it
            Has two walls, or tags: open and close tag
    *
        <html> tag
            Means "everything inside this is HTML"
        <body> tag
            Everything that shows up on your page
        <head> tag
            Stuff that doesn't show up on the page itself
            <title>
                What shows up in your bookmarks bar
                Or on Google searches

        You use it to distinguish bits of content from each other
    *
        <div> tags in blank.html
        
        Now you can style things
    *
        "style" attribute
            What's an attribute?
                Something you put inside a tag that affects it somehow
            Make top <div> tag look like a header
        
        Two rules of HTML:
            1. Elements have to be closed
    *
        http://www.sewingandembroiderywarehouse.com/embtrb.htm
        
            2. Elements have to be completely contained within another element
                An element can have multiple children, but only one parent
    *
        Un-nest some <div>s on blank.html

        With that in mind, we can start making an actual site
    *
        Add divs and content
        
    Standard tags
        What if I want every other element to be red?
            Clearly kind of a pain to just use divs all the time and style individually
        HTML provides lots of standard tags besides <div>
        Sectioning tags
            <header>
            <main>
            <footer>
        Grouping tags
            <p>
            <blockquote>
    ?
        How to make all paragraphs red?
            Just style the <main> element
    ?
        But what if I want paragraphs red and blockquotes blue?
        
        Stylesheet
            Define the rules for a bunch of elements all at once
            Inside the <head> tag
                Won't show up directly on page, but will affect page
            1. Selector: what elements you want to select
            2. Properties: how you want to style the elements
    *
        Make all <p> red and all <blockquote> blue
        
        Can get really fancy
    *
        p:nth-of-type = red
        
        LOTS of other standard tags
    ***
        Add in <link rel="stylesheet" href="blank.css" />
        
        You DON'T need to memorize tags
            References available EVERYWHERE
            Like learning Spanish, except
                Grammar's simpler
                You can use the dictionary all the time without feeling awkward
        Semantics
            Tags themselves don't add styles to your content
                No <red> tag
            Form follows function
                Style usually reflects the purpose of the words
                    Probably want all paragraphs to look one way, and all headers to look another way
                Semantics
                    Meaning of words
    *            
        Go through worksheet
        
    ?
        <header> vs <head> vs <h1>,<h2>,<h3>...
            All totally different

    ?
        Why does <br /> look different?
        
        Special characters
            Use < and > as examples

    *
        Fresh Prince activity
        
Standards
    *
        Take away Belair CSS
        
    So many bad websites that web browsers now just add in their own styling to make stuff look presentable, in case the designer didn't include any CSS
        You can't rely on this
            Browsers use different fonts, put different borders on things, etc
            ESPECIALLY old browsers, mobile browsers, and Internet Explorer
                Why everyone hates IE
                "Browser compatiblity" is a time-suck
    If you want something to look a certain way, you must specify it in CSS
        
        
Beyond HTML/CSS
    Reiterate Spanish:
        Seems like we just touched on it?
        It's like a language with really simple grammar
        No-one will judge you for using a dictionary
            EVERYONE uses the dictionary
        Want to make a <p> tag red?
            Just Google "how to make p tag red"

    HTML and CSS are client-side languages
        Means they give your computer instructions
    *
        Will Smith's script
            HTML is like stage/acting directions
            CSS is like costumes
            
        Javascript also client-side
            Used for actions:
                If this happens, then that happens
    *
        Show js.html examples
        
        Great for styling, bad for security
            Can see all the JS on someone's site
            Wouldn't want people to see how you read passwords
            
    Server-side languages
        Will Smith's script
            When he gets your order, he saves your credit card information so you don't need to send it again
            Not something he's telling you to do -- he's doing it on his end
            
        Server-side scripts
            Doing stuff on the server
                Changing content before it gets to your computer
                Saving information about you
                
    *
        Show index.php
            Looks like HTML, right?
        Show worksheet.php
            All this stuff happens before the server sends you the HTML
        
        Other languages
            Ruby, Python, blah blah blah

Absolute vs relative


In Stratford-on-Avon, born and raised,
In the theater is where I spent most of my days,
Acting,
Casting,
Redacting, old-school,
And I was in London writing up Falstaff, the fool,
When my playhouse's landlord got up to no good
So I tore down the building and reused the wood
From that one little fight was born the Globe Theater
And that's how I became the Master of Metre



In Eastern Denmark I was born and raised,
But in Wittenberg's where I spent most of my days
Reading
Exceeding
In my schoolwork, and all
And I was with a couple guys up on the castle wall
When a scary old ghost -- he looked like my dad --
Confirmed that he'd been murdered like I thought he had
Against the rotten old king I started to plot
And ask myself the question, "To be, or not?"


In Eastern Denmark, born and raised
Sick at heart's how I spent most of my days
Soliloquizing
Elegizing
Despising it all
I was shooting the breeze up on the castle wall
With a couple of guys -- when I heard from a ghost
That my father had been poisoned and that's why he's toast
It took just one little haunt and I started to plot
And ask myself the question, "To be, or not?"



Will's written a new rap, but has a cold and can't perform it. Needs someone else to do it.
Will wants someone to write a biography about his life.
Will wants someone to turn his life story into a book.
Will wants someone to turn his life story into a website.

-Multiple people requesting the information
-Will/Will's secretary are separating it into semantic chunks
-Information is all in the same "voice", w/ same narrator
